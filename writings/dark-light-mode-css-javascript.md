I've implemented dark/light mode before using `styled-components`
as well as `SCSS`, but this time I wanted to do it just using `CSS`,
so gave it a go, and it's so simple.

## The CSS

First of all lets create a `style.css` file, it can be in the root
of our project, we'll keep this simple and straight to the point.

Open your command line, navigate to whatever folder you keep your projects
and run the following:

```bash
take dark-light-mode && touch style.css
```

> If you're wondering what `take` does, it'll create a new directory for you and auto navigate to it.

Now, in our `style.css` file lets put the following code, this will be the variables for the default (light) theme:

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: #fff;
  --text-color: #000;
}
```

In order to see this working, we need to create a `HTML` file, so lets do
that, in your command line run:

```bash
touch index.html
```

And put the following code, you can notice we're already importing our
`style.css` file:

```html:5
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Light and Dark Mode</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Our own dark / light app!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

If you go ahead and open `index.html` in your browser you should see
a title **"Our own dark / light app!"**.

<br />

Now let us start adding some styling. We'll be using `var(--variable-name)`, that's
the way you can re-use and call variables in css:

```css:6-9
:root {
  --bg-color: #fff;
  --text-color: #000;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--bg-color);
  color: var(--text-color);
}
```

If you go ahead and refresh your page it should look exactly the same, and that's alright.

<br />

Before jumping into the **JavaScript** part, we can add our variables for the dark
theme already:

```css:6-9
:root {
  --bg-color: #fff;
  --text-color: #000;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg-color: #000;
  --text-color: #fff;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--bg-color);
  color: var(--text-color);
}
```

What are we doing here?

- Using `[data-theme="dark"]` that we'll cover in the JavaScript section;
- Swaping the background and the text colors from white to black and vice-versa;

---

## The JavaScript

Alright, now we just need a small JavaScript code to get this working, in
your `index.html` file add the following code:

```html:7-12
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Light and Dark Mode</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Wait for document to load
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
      document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", "dark");
    });
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Our own dark / light app!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, if you refresh the page you'll see that it switched to a `#000` background
and `#fff` text. Cool beans right?

Lets break this down, what `document.documentElement` gets it's the `html` tag from
our `index.html`, so even without the JavaScript code we could do:

```html:!2
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-theme="dark">

<!-- Rest of the code -->
```

This would have exactly the same effect, but we want to use JavaScript to we
can change it dynamically.

<br />

## The Switch

Lets make some changes to our JavaScript and also add a button to our `index.html` that will trigger the theme change:

> Check the comments in the code, it might be easier to keep track of what's happening

```html:31,!-12-26
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Light and Dark Mode</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Wait for document to load
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
      document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", "light");

      // Get our button switcher
      var themeSwitcher = document.getElementById("theme-switcher");

      // When our button gets clicked
      themeSwitcher.onclick = function() {
        // Get the current selected theme, on the first run
        // it should be `light`
        var currentTheme = document.documentElement.getAttribute("data-theme");

        // Switch between `dark` and `light`
        var switchToTheme = currentTheme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark"

        // Set our currenet theme to the new one
        document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", switchToTheme);
      }
    });
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="theme-switcher">Switch themes!</button>
  <h1>Our own dark / light app!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

<br />

And that's it! Try it out, it should go from `light` to `dark` and vice-versa.

I've been noticing that one of the biggest issues with new developers is that they think they need to know **EVERYTHING**.

Don't fool yourself, there's not one single developer in the world that knows everything, all those high tech people you look up to, they **don't** know everything, that's a fact. You can always argue with someone about their opinion, you can't argue against facts.

I've been coding for 13+ years, you might think "Wow, that's a lot, he must know so much." ‚Äî well, yeah, it's a lot but I guarantee you I don't know everything, I'm far from it. But, the good news it that it's OK, we don't need to know everything.

Let me give you an example. You might ask me _how to find an odd number in JavaScript_, do I know how to do it? No, I don't, but here's some code:

```js
function isOdd(num) { return num % 2 }
```

Now, you might think, he **did** knew how to do it. Again, no, I didn't, I just googled it. Am I cheating at programming? **No!**

_Well, you googled it, sure, but you know what `%` it's doing_. Flash news, no, I don't. I have absolutely no idea what it's doing.

And again, that's OK.

Want another example? Sure.

_"Hey, you know how to use `useState` in React?"_

```js
const [published, setPublished] = useState(false);

// [...]

setPublished(true)

// [...]

published ? "Well, yes!" : "Not yet, sorry!"
```

## How useState works?

No fucking idea, I know it updates a component's state, I know how to set it, to change it, when to use it, etc; What's happening behind the scenes? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Most developers don't know a LOT of things, they just know how to un-shit themselves.

I know how to build things, I learn fast, but if you ask me what's a `function` I have no idea, I can explain what it does, I can explain how and when to use it. But the technical description of _"A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task."_, fuck that.

I had to write this, I get a little frustrated when a lot of people think they must know everything. **You don't.**

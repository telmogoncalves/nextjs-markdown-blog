The main reason for writing this post is to explain why to use `16777215`, looks kind of a random number and can be a little misleading.

---

## Why 16777215?
If you're familiar with `RGB` (Red, Green, Blue), you know it's represented by a number from `0` to `255`, an example of a colour using RGB would look like:

```css
/* Same as #ffffff */
color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
```

Now, if we do `256 * 256 * 256` we end up with `16,777,216`, now why do we remove 1 from this value?

We want to convert into a hexadecimal format and `16777216` converts to `1000000`, while `16777215` converts to `ffffff`.

I did a little research but mainly this came from here, thanks Jacob:

There are other explanations, based directly on the hexadecimal code, but I felt this one made more sense and it was simpler.
